YAML's focuses more narrowly on cleanly representing the data structures and data types you encounter in dynamic programming languages like Perl, Python, Ruby, and to a lesser extent, Java programming. Bindings/libraries currently exist for those languages. A number of other languages have data models that will play nice with YAML, but no one has written libraries yet. These include Lisp/Scheme, Rebol, Smalltalk, xBase, and AWK. Less dynamic languages would not fit as well with YAML. The syntax of YAML combines the contextual typing of Perl, the indentation structure of Python, and a few conventions from MIME standards. In much the same way that Python is sometimes praised as executable pseudocode, YAML's concrete syntax comes very close to what you might use to informally explain a data structure to a class or work group.
